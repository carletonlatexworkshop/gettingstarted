Hello, and welcome to \LaTeX{}!
If you're just hearing about \LaTeX{} for the first time, you should read this document once through from beginning to end before you do anything with your computer.
\Cref{s:prelim} is a brief introduction to the philosophy and core concepts of \LaTeX{} as a system for producing documents.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{s:prelim}
You've probably used a word processor (like Microsoft's Word or OpenOffice Writer) to produce documents in the past.
\LaTeX{} is also a way to produce documents, but it's very different.

A typical \LaTeX{} document looks something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,caption=Basic \LaTeX{} example,label=lst:basicex]
  \documentclass{article}
  \title{Article title}
  \author{Author name}
  \begin{document}
  \maketitle
  This is an example of a document file.
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

It's code!
\LaTeX{} is a \emph{structured markup language}, sort of like HTML; you build a document by writing some text which is \enquote{marked up} with information which describes that text's structure.
This code is the interpreted by a computer program which renders it into a nicely typeset PDF.

\LaTeX{} has a lot of great advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  It's great at handling complex typesetting tasks like mathematical formulas.
  Check this out:
  \begin{equation}
    R = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pbrac{x_{i} - \bar{x}} \pbrac{y_{i} - \bar{y}} }{ \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \pbrac{x_{i} - \bar{x}}^{2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \pbrac{y_{i} - \bar{y}}^{2}} }
    \label{eq:statsthing}
  \end{equation}
  or this:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:greens}
    \iint_{\Sigma} \cbrac*{ \pbrac*{ \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}} \dd y \dd z +\pbrac*{\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial R}{\partial x}} \dd z \dd x  + \pbrac*{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}} \dd x \dd y}
    = \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \cbrac{P \dd x + Q\dd y + R \dd z}
  \end{equation}
  Pretty slick, huh?

\item
  It separates content from style.
  For example, to start a new section of a document, you just type \verb|\section{Name of section}|, and to produce text which is \emph{emphasized}, you just type \verb|\emph{emphasized}|.
  This means that you never have to worry about remembering how to style any particular element, and it makes writing documents \emph{much faster} once you get the hang of it.

\item
  It produces beautiful documents.
  The underlying \TeX{} typesetting engine is extremely powerful and professional-grade.
  Your eyes will thank you!

\item
  It has powerful cross-referencing and other document tools.
  For example, I can refer to \cref{eq:greens} above simply by typing \verb|\label{eq:greens}| in the code for the equation and then \verb|\ref{eq:greens}| down here.
  The numbering is handled automatically, so I can move things around or even change the numbering scheme without breaking it.

\item
  It's highly portable.
  The source code you write is plain text, so you can email it, post it on a website, or even print it out and type it back in without messing anything up.
  The rendered documents are PDF, which will look the same on any computer in the world.
  No more worrying about what versions of Word everyone in your group is using!
\end{itemize}

Of course, it also has some disadvantages and costs.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  You'll need to install some software to \enquote{compile} \LaTeX{} source, and you'll probably need a better text editor than Notepad or TextEdit.
  We'll take care of that shortly.

\item
  It's hard to use \LaTeX{} for page layout.
  It will format your documents the way it thinks is best, and you're going to have a bad time if you try to tell it what to do.
  Go with the flow and focus on your content; your documents will look great!
  (If you have specific page-layout needs, like a newsletter or event poster, \LaTeX{} probably isn't the right software for that task.)

\item
  You don't know how to use it.
  \textbf{Yet.}
\end{itemize}
